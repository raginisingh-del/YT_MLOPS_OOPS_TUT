Repository Setup: Create a git repo and clone it in local.
Code Creation: Create code.py and add code to it (it will save a csv file to a new "data" folder).
Initial Git Sync: Do a git add-commit-push before initializing dvc.
DVC Initialization: Now we do "dvc init" (creates .dvcignore, .dvc).
Storage Setup: Now do "mkdir S3" (creates a new S3 directory).
Remote Configuration: Now we do "dvc remote add -d myremote S3".
Data Tracking Transition: Next "dvc add data/". Now it will ask to do: ("git rm -r --cached 'data'" and "git commit -m "stop tracking data"") because initially we were tracking data/ folder from git so now we remove it for DVC to handle.
DVC Metadata: Again we do "dvc add data/" (creates data.dvc) then "git add .gitignore data.dvc".
Data Persistence: Now - "dvc commit" and then "dvc push". Do a git add-commit-push to mark this stage as first version of data.
Dataset Updates: Now make changes to code.py to append a new row in data, check changes via "dvc status".
Sync V2 Data: Again - "dvc commit" and then "dvc push".
Final Sync: Then git add-commit-push (we're saving V2 of our data at this point).
Verification: Check dvc/git status, everything should be up to date.
Iteration: Now repeat step 10-12 for v3 of data.
